### Navigation

The top 3 lines of the page show the menus. The top line is the main menu, to select which module you want to use. The second line gives options in that module, and the third line shows options for the particular screen in view.

On small devices such as mobile phones, the menu is hidden to save screen space - to display it, click the menu symbol ![Menu symbol](../images/menu.png).

Input forms will show one or more of the following buttons

|Button|Function|
|------|--------|
|Save|Saves the data in the current form, but remains on the same page. If crteating a new invoice (say), clicking this will save the data and reveal new buttons to (e.g.) print the invoice.|
|Save and Close|Saves the data in the current form, and returns to the previous screen.|
|Reset|Throws away any changes you have made to the current form. This will ask you to confirm before doing so.|
|Back|Closes the current form and returns to the previous screen.|
|Cancel|Throws away any changes you have made to the current form and returns to the previous screen. This will ask you to confirm before doing so.|

Many screens present a list of items - you can select an individual item from the screen by clicking on it (N.B. if you use a touch screen, touch an item once to move the highlight to it, then touch again to actually open it). If the number of items is too many to fit on the screen, they are presented a page at a time. You can navigate between the pages using the links at the bottom right of the page. You can also control how many items are shown on each page with the Show *N* entries drop down at the top left. There is a search bar at the top right - typing in this will instantly show just items which match what you have typed (you can clear the search with the x at the right end of the field). You can also sort the items by any of the columns by clicking on the column header - clicking sorts in ascending order, clicking again changes to a descending sort.
